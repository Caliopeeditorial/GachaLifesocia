# About Indiego

Indiego is built with patience and care by [Jake Rayson](https://github.com/growdigital/), a frontend developer in West Wales, UK. 

It is three things: 

1. **Hugo starter kit**: hit the ground with the fantastically fast & flexible [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
2. **Socially aware**: all blog and status posts created will generate a preview in different social platforms.
3. **Modular frontend workflow**: the starter kit is just the starting point â€“ using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), the frontend developer can easily create new CSS components which are combined and optimised automagically.
